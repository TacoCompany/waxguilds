### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

We have completed the change from full to partial Hyperion API.

Throughout May 20th, we began detecting abnormal increases in latency on our mainnet producer nodes, so we began performing upgrade and maintenance tasks. These tasks were completed successfully without any lost rounds. The results have been very positive, with a considerable reduction in latency.

In accordance with updates to the assessment requirements, we have removed our IPFS node from the infrastructure information.

We're working on improving the performance of our P2P nodes to meet the new qualification requirements. While the linked public node has always had a complete block history, it seems to be having trouble sharing it.

We're maintaining our Hyperion API (full) and Atomic API testnet infrastructure. Both services were down for a few hours during maintenance.

### WAX Developer Portal (community project)

**URLs**: https://developer.wax.io/

In this contribution, I focused exclusively on translating the React Native SDK documentation from English to Spanish for the WAX Developer project. The goal was to provide Spanish-speaking developers with clear, accurate, and complete resources for integrating WAX with React Native applications.

### Key Contributions

- **Full Translation of React Native SDK Documentation:**  
  Faithfully translated all documentation files related to the React Native SDK, ensuring the Spanish versions match the originals in structure, technical content, code examples, and internal/external links.

- **Files Translated:**
  - `index.md` (Overview and features)
  - `dapp-backend.md` (Backend requirements, example code, configuration, and API key process)
  - `repository.md` (Repository structure and example app)
  - `sample-dapp.md` (Reference to example app)
  - `sdk.md` (SDK usage and integration)

- **Consistency and Quality:**  
  Maintained technical accuracy, consistent terminology, and formatting throughout the translated documents to ensure usability and professionalism.
