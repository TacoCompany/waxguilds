### HeadsUp - Monitoring and Alerts

**URLs**: https://github.com/eosphere/HeadsUp-Monitoring-Alerts 

**Update**: 

The EOSphere Team have released HeadsUp v0.2.0 this month.

This release is a clean up of the code base and includes front end caching performance changes.

Over 8000 lines of code have been removed and the code framework is now structured in a more modular way. This means better operational efficiency and simpler feature additions.

This next month we will be fixing a few bugs in relation to email notifications, the banner and favicon not always showing and will investigate adding the CPU mechanics contract.

Take a look at the public showcase -> https://headsup.eosphere.io/
